> **Note:** Your organization's Duo Mobile devices page either uses the new Universal Prompt, or the dated Traditional Prompt. You can toggle between them with these buttons:

You don't need to enter your phone number, it doesn't affect the setup. Click the I have a tablet button instead. If you include your phone number, it'll simply associate the number with the device and have no impact on functionality.

#### 4. Scan the QR Code
A QR code will be generated. Open Duochrome on the same page as the QR code and it should handle the rest. If you don't see a QR code, or it's failing to scan it, go to Step 6.

#### 5. Email code to yourself

If the QR code didn't work, click Get an activation link instead and get your inbox ready to receive the code. Duo will email you the activation code. Once you receive it, click the link included in the email. Make sure you open this link on your computer and not your phone to prevent the Duo Mobile app from auto-opening it.

#### 6. Activate
