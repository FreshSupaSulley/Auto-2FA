# DuOSU Setup Tutorial
Here's how to generate an activation code for your DuOSU extension:

#### Step 1 - Add a new device

To add DuOSU as a new device, you need to find your organization's Duo Mobile devices website.
Usually you can find this website by googling it (ex. "duo mobile buckeyes"). Here's the [link](https://osu.login.duosecurity.com/devices?link_clicked=true/) for OSU students.
Once you find the website, click the "Add a new Device" button.

#### Step 2 - Select Duo Mobile

DuOSU is treated like the app, so click the Duo Mobile app option.

#### Step 3 - Click "I have a tablet"

There's no need to enter your phone number, it has no effect on the setup. Click the "I have a tablet" button instead.
If you put in your phone number, it'll simply associate the number with the device.

#### Step 4 - Click "Next"

Duo will prompt you download the app for your tablet. You can ignore this.

#### Step 5 - Click "Get an activation link instead"

A QR code will pop up. It's the activation code in picture form, but **don't scan it**!
Click "Get an activation link instead", and get your email ready to receive the code.

#### Step 6 - Enter your email address

Duo will send you the activation code in the text based form that we need. Once you click send, navigate to your email and find the message.

#### Step 7 - Activate

Click on the link in the message. You'll see a box in the center of the page containing the activation code!
Copy and paste the text in the box into the box in DuOSU and click activate. DuOSU will be activated!
