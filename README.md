# DuOSU
Bypass Duo Mobile push with a click of a button.

Opening Duo Mobile on your phone to login is too time consuming. Duo doesn't offer the ability to accept push notifications on your computer, so this chrome extension offers that support.

The chrome extension was built in HTML / JS, but I've included a Java example program on how to incorporate this in a full-scale application. The Java application uses the following Maven repositories:

• Jackson JSON Library
• Apache HTTP Client

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
  <version>2.13.3</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
	<artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
	<version>4.5.13</version>
</dependency>
```
